## Project Description

This project focuses on building a **Handwritten digit recognition system**. The goal of the project is to design and implement differnt machine learning models capable of recognizing and classifying these handwritten digits with high accuracy and comparing their efficiencies and performance.
#### Dataset Used:
The dataset used in this project is the **MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)** dataset, which is a large collection of handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset consists of **60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 pixels**. The images are labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9). This dataset is widely used for training image recognition models and serves as a standard benchmark for evaluating machine learning algorithms, especially in the field of computer vision.
